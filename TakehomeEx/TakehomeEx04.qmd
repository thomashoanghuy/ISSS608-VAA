# The Task

In this take-home exercise, we need to uncover the impact of COVID-19 as well as the global economic and political dynamic in 2022 on Singapore bi-lateral trade (i.e.Â Import, Export and Trade Balance) by using appropriate analytical visualisation techniques learned in **Lesson 6: It's About Time**.

# The Data

For the purpose of this take-home exercise, Merchandise Trade provided by Department of Statistics, Singapore (DOS) will be used. The data are available under the sub-section of Merchandise Trade by Region/Market. The study period should be between **January 2020 to December 2022**.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(readxl)
pacman::p_load(readr)
pacman::p_load(ggstatsplot)
pacman::p_load(ggbraid)
pacman::p_load(gganimate)
pacman::p_load(transformr , gifski)
pacman::p_load(tidyverse)
```

## IMPORT VERSUS EXPORT

We want to do a comparison between Singapore Import and Export, first let's import the data.

```{r}
monthlyexport_overall <- read_excel("C:/thomashoanghuy/ISSS608-VAA/TakehomeEx/data3/outputFile.xlsx", sheet = "T1")

monthlyimport_overall <- read_excel("C:/thomashoanghuy/ISSS608-VAA/TakehomeEx/data3/outputFile.xlsx", sheet = "T8")
```

Sheet T1 = Merchandise Exports By Commodity Division, Monthly snippet

Sheet T2 = Merchandise Imports By Commodity Division, Monthly snippet

![](images/monthlyimportt8.JPG)

As you can see from above 2 snippets of the data table, most of the sub categories are similar between export and import data. However the highlight rows are the difference between the 2 sets of data. We should remove them before we can start any comparisons.

```{r}
monthlyexport_overall <- monthlyexport_overall[!grepl("Oil Bunkers", monthlyexport_overall$`Data Series`),]


```

```{r}

monthlyimport_overall <- monthlyimport_overall[!grepl("Meat & Meat Preparations", monthlyimport_overall$`Data Series`),]
monthlyimport_overall <- monthlyimport_overall[!grepl("Footwear", monthlyimport_overall$`Data Series`),]
```

Now both tables would have the same sub categories of merchandises for comparison.

Now. we can extract the total Export Merchandise Import and Export and we can combine them into a separate dataframe

```{r}
monthlyexport_total <- monthlyexport_overall[grepl("Total Merchandise Exports", monthlyexport_overall$`Data Series`),]
```

```{r}
monthlyimport_total <- monthlyimport_overall[grepl("Total Merchandise Imports", monthlyimport_overall$`Data Series`),]
```

```{r}
monthly_tradebalance1 = rbind(monthlyexport_total , monthlyimport_total)

monthly_tradebalance1= as.data.frame(t(monthly_tradebalance1)) 
colnames(monthly_tradebalance1) <- monthly_tradebalance1[1,]
monthly_tradebalance1 <- monthly_tradebalance1[-1,]

head(monthly_tradebalance1)
```

```{r}
monthly_tradebalance <- monthly_tradebalance1 %>% 
  rownames_to_column(var = "Month-Year")


```

```{r}
tail(monthly_tradebalance)
```

Reverse sort the data frame "monthly_tradebalance"

```{r}
monthly_tradebalance <- monthly_tradebalance[nrow(monthly_tradebalance):1, ]
rownames(monthly_tradebalance) <- rownames(monthly_tradebalance[nrow(monthly_tradebalance):1, ])

head(monthly_tradebalance)
```

```{r}
monthly_tradebalance$`Month-Year` <- as.Date(paste0(monthly_tradebalance$`Month-Year`, " 01"), format = "%Y %b %d")
```

```{r}
monthly_tradebalance
```

```{r}
monthly_tradebalance$`Total Merchandise Exports` <- as.numeric(monthly_tradebalance$`Total Merchandise Exports`)
monthly_tradebalance$`Total Merchandise Imports` <- as.numeric(monthly_tradebalance$`Total Merchandise Imports`)
```

```{r}
monthly_tradebalanceMelt <- reshape2::melt(monthly_tradebalance, id.var='Month-Year')
```

```{r}
p1 = ggplot(monthly_tradebalanceMelt, aes(x=monthly_tradebalanceMelt$`Month-Year` , y=value, col=variable, group = 1)) +
  geom_point() + geom_line(aes(group=factor(variable))) +
  xlab("Year") + ylab("Trade Volume in Billions")

p1
```

As evidenced by the above chart, Singapore import and export move quite in tandem with each other. Between 2020-2023, it shows an uptrend. As Export volume increase, so does Import. However Singapore overall Export are more than its Import, consistently since post-covid 2020, Singapore remains with trade surplus overall.

While trade surplus are confirmed, we should examine how Singapore trade surplus is trending post-covid, let's create a data table of the difference between Export and Import ( the trade surplus)

```{r}
monthly_tradebalance$Trade_surplus = monthly_tradebalance$`Total Merchandise Exports` - monthly_tradebalance$`Total Merchandise Imports`
```

```{r}
monthly_tradebalance
```

```{r}
p2<- ggplot(monthly_tradebalance, aes(x=monthly_tradebalance$`Month-Year` , y= monthly_tradebalance$Trade_surplus, group = 1)) +
  geom_point() + geom_line() + geom_smooth()+
  xlab("Year") + ylab("Trade Volume in Billions")

p2
```

If we only look at the figure p1 above, one may say that Singapore trade data displayed a healthy uptrend both covid until recent 2022. However. once we examine the trade balance/surplus, Singapore trade surplus was only fluctuating between 3.5 billions and 8.5 billions on monthly basis and it is not on the steady uptrend at all.

Even at beginning of 2022, it even dropped to nearly 2.5 billions for April 2022 and that is the lowest level in 2 years period. If we look at the geom_smooth graph, we can see that the trade surplus of Singapore is actually on the downtrend since second half of 2020.

This contracts the general consensus that post-covid, with resume of physical trades, Singapore trade surplus should be picking up. However, the data here suggests that as the world resumes normality, Singapore trade surplus is on the downtrend instead.

## DOMESTIC EXPORT VS RE-EXPORT
